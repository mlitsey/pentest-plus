# 1: Introduction

This room is the third in the Nmap series (part of the Introduction to Network Security module). In the first two rooms, we learned about live host discovery and basic port scans.

1. [Nmap Live Host Discovery](https://tryhackme.com/room/nmap01)
2. [Nmap Basic Port Scans](https://tryhackme.com/room/nmap02)
3. [Nmap Advanced Port Scans](https://tryhackme.com/room/nmap03)
4. [Nmap Post Port Scans](https://tryhackme.com/room/nmap04)

In [Nmap Basic Port Scans](https://tryhackme.com/room/nmap02), we covered TCP flags and reviewed the TCP 3-way handshake. To initiate a connection, TCP requires the first packet to have the SYN flag set. Consequently, we can tell if a TCP port is open based on the response we receive.

Security researchers and hackers contemplated the TCP flags, shown in the figure below and explained in the previous room, and started to experiment. They wanted to know what would happen if we send a TCP packet, which is not part of any ongoing TCP connection, with one or more flags set.

For instance, an ACK flag is set when you want to acknowledge received data. An ACK scan is like trying to acknowledge data that was neither sent nor received in the first place. Consider this simple analogy, someone coming to you out of nowhere to tell you, “yes, I hear you, please continue.” when you haven’t said anything.

This room explains advanced types of scans and scan options. Some of these scan types can be useful against specific systems, while others are useful in particular network setups. We will cover the following types of port scans:

- Null Scan
- FIN Scan
- Xmas Scan
- Maimon Scan
- ACK Scan
- Window Scan
- Custom Scan

Moreover, we will cover the following:

- Spoofing IP
- Spoofing MAC
- Decoy Scan
- Fragmented Packets
- Idle/Zombie Scan

We will discuss options and techniques to evade firewalls and IDS systems. We also cover options to get more verbose details from Nmap.



# 2: TCP Null Scan, FIN Scan, and Xmas Scan

Let’s start with the following three types of scans:

- Null Scan
- FIN Scan
- Xmas Scan

  

### Null Scan

The null scan does not set any flag; all six flag bits are set to zero. You can choose this scan using the `-sN` option. A TCP packet with no flags set will not trigger any response when it reaches an open port, as shown in the figure below. Therefore, from Nmap’s perspective, a lack of reply in a null scan indicates that either the port is open or a firewall is blocking the packet.

However, we expect the target server to respond with an RST packet if the port is closed. Consequently, we can use the lack of RST response to figure out the ports that are not closed: open or filtered.

Below is an example of a null scan against a Linux server. The null scan we carried out has successfully identified the six open ports on the target system. Because the null scan relies on the lack of a response to infer that the port is not closed, it cannot indicate with certainty that these ports are open; there is a possibility that the ports are not responding due to a firewall rule.

Pentester Terminal

```
pentester@TryHackMe$ sudo nmap -sN MACHINE_IP

Starting Nmap 7.60 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-08-30 10:30 BST

```
        

Note that many Nmap options require root privileges. Unless you are running Nmap as root, you need to use `sudo` as in the example above using the `-sN` option.

  

### FIN Scan

The FIN scan sends a TCP packet with the FIN flag set. You can choose this scan type using the `-sF` option. Similarly, no response will be sent if the TCP port is open. Again, Nmap cannot be sure if the port is open or if a firewall is blocking the traffic related to this TCP port.

However, the target system should respond with an RST if the port is closed. Consequently, we will be able to know which ports are closed and use this knowledge to infer the ports that are open or filtered. It's worth noting some firewalls will 'silently' drop the traffic without sending an RST.

Below is an example of a FIN scan against a Linux server. The result is quite similar to the result we obtained earlier using a null scan.

Pentester Terminal

```
pentester@TryHackMe$ sudo nmap -sF MACHINE_IP

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 96.52 seconds
```
        

  

### Xmas Scan

The Xmas scan gets its name after Christmas tree lights. An Xmas scan sets the FIN, PSH, and URG flags simultaneously. You can select Xmas scan with the option `-sX`.

Like the Null scan and FIN scan, if an RST packet is received, it means that the port is closed. Otherwise, it will be reported as open|filtered.

The following two figures show the case when the TCP port is open and the case when the TCP port is closed.

![](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5f04259cf9bf5b57aed2c476/room-content/7d28b756aed3b6eb72faf98d6974776c.png)

The console output below shows an example of a Xmas scan against a Linux server. The obtained results are pretty similar to that of the null scan and the FIN scan.

Pentester Terminal

```
pentester@TryHackMe$ sudo nmap -sX MACHINE_IP

Starting Nmap 7.60 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-08-30 10:34 BST

One scenario where these three scan types can be efficient is when scanning a target behind a stateless (non-stateful) firewall. A stateless firewall will check if the incoming packet has the SYN flag set to detect a connection attempt. Using a flag combination that does not match the SYN packet makes it possible to deceive the firewall and reach the system behind it. However, a stateful firewall will practically block all such crafted packets and render this kind of scan useless.
