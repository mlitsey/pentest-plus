On TryHackMe you'll learn by starting and hacking machines

Lets start your AttackBox, a web-based machine used to attack other machines you start on tasks.

1. Click the blue ![](https://assets.tryhackme.com/img/getting-started/start_attackbox_button.png) button at the top of this room; the AttackBox is what you will use to access target machines you start on tasks such as this one.  
    
2. Start the target machine shown on this task and wait 1 minute for it to configure.

3. Copy the IP Address of the machine that you just started on this task, then on the AttackBox (right-hand side), open up Firefox (on the AttackBox) and paste the IP Address into the URL bar.![](https://assets.tryhackme.com/img/getting-started/target_machine_to_attackbox.png)  
    _The machines you start on tasks (left hand-side) are the "target machines" and are accessed by the AttackBox (right hand-side)._
    
Alternatively you can access machines via [OpenVPN](https://tryhackme.com/access?o=vpn)

You can also use an OpenVPN connection and use your own computer. Follow the steps on the [OpenVPN page](https://tryhackme.com/access?o=vpn) for further instructions on connecting. Once connected to our network via OpenVPN, deploy the machine on this task and paste its IP into your own browser.

  

When you've finished with a machine in any room, make sure to stop it by clicking the red "Terminate" button.

_**Answer the questions below**_

Follow the steps in this task. What is the flag text shown on the website of the machine you started on this task?  
_A flag is just a piece of text that's used to verify you've performed a certain action. In security challenges, users are asked to find flags to prove that they've successfully hacked a machine_
